The application is designed to work with linear and quadratic functions, as well as quadratic and linear equations.

The application has three interface languages: Karakalpak, Russian and English.

The user has access to the ability to store and view the exercises done.
There is also the ability to view reference materials (videos and sites).

The user can select the type of the desired function (equation) and enter the values of the coefficients of his choice.

For equations, the application calculates the roots and displays their value (or text message about their absence).

Along with the roots, the application also shows a graph of the corresponding (by coefficients) function.

In the application, you can set the range of values along the X axis and the number of points, and then get the plotted function graph and the list of coordinates of the corresponding points.

It is possible to rip out the date and time for the next time you work with the application and at the right time a reminder will appear on the phone in advance.
